## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- (Optional) Local HTTP server to avoid CORS when loading local assets

   git clone https://github.com/passimon/shortest-route.git
   cd shortestroute
   ```
2. Serve the files locally. For example, using **http-server**:

   http-server . -p 8080
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your browser.

---

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.  
2. Grant location access if you want the ‚ÄúLocate me‚Äù feature.

## Configuration

Most configuration is done directly in `index.html` (or your custom main HTML file):

- **Map tile provider** ‚Äì modify in `scripts/leaflet-providers.js`.  
- **Routing service** ‚Äì by default it may use a public OpenRouteService endpoint. To switch to your own API key or different service, update the router options in `scripts/main.js`.  
- **Chart options** ‚Äì located in the Chart.js initialization block.  
- **CookieConsent** ‚Äì edit `styles/ext.cookieconsent.css` or initialize with your domain in the snippet.

---

## Extending & Customization

- **Add more Leaflet plugins** by including their CSS/JS in the `<head>`.  
- **Custom map styles** ‚Äì swap out the tile-provider URL or add Mapbox/Carto styles.  
- **Localization** ‚Äì wrap all UI labels in a JSON dictionary and load based on user locale.  
- **Theming** ‚Äì override Bootstrap variables or drop in your own SCSS.  

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Map not loading / CORS errors**  
  - Ensure you‚Äôre serving via HTTP, not `file://`.  
  - Check console for blocked requests‚Äîupdate your API keys or proxy settings.
- **Routes failing**  
  - Verify your routing API key and endpoint URL.  
  - Inspect network calls in DevTools for detailed error messages.
- **Plugin conflicts**  
  - Make sure you‚Äôre including compatible versions of Leaflet and its plugins.
